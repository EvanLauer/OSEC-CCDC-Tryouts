pfSense Misconfigs

1: Management Exposure (WAN Rule)
	WAN firewall rule TCP Pass to any source on WAN address on ports 80 and 443
	Allows anyone on the internet to see your firewall's login page. An attacker can now attempt to brute-force the "admin" password.

2. Bypass All (Floating Rule)
	Applies to all interfaces and overrides standard interface rules. effectively turn off the firewall entirely
	Firewall > Rules > Floating. 
	Action: Pass 
	Quick: Check this box (This makes the rule apply immediately, skipping other checks).
	Interface: WAN (and any others listed).
	Direction, Protocol, Source, Destination: any

3. Disable Packet Filtering
	Navigate to System > Advanced > Firewall & NAT.
	Check the box Disable all packet filtering.
	This turns pfSense into a simple, wide-open router. All rules (WAN, LAN, Floating) are ignored. It’s the "off switch" for security.

4. Modify Traffic to Make Firewall Visible
	Navigate to: System > Advanced > Firewall & NAT.
	Find: "IP Do-Not-Fragment compatibility" check it
	DF Bits: By clearing the "Don't Fragment" bit instead of dropping the packet, you are modifying traffic in a way that reveals the firewall is intercepting and tampering with packets

5. Protocol Downgrade
	Navigate to System > Advanced > Admin Access.
	Change Protocol to HTTP

6. Open WebGUI Redirect
	System > Advanced > Admin Access
	Check the box "Disable webConfigurator redirect"
	If you disable the redirect but don't explicitly block Port 80 on your firewall rules, the port might stay "Open" but just show a "Connection Refused" or a blank page

7. Interface Information Leakage
	System > Advanced > Networking
	Disable hardware checksum offloading
	
8. Unlocked Console
	System > Advanced > Admin Access
	Uncheck Password protect the console menu
	Anyone with physical access can walk up to the machine and select Option 3 (Reset Admin Password) or Option 4 (Reset to Factory Defaults) without ever typing a password.

9. DNS Rebind (Information Leakage)
	System > Advanced > Admin Access. Check "Disable DNS Rebinding Checks"
	Allows a malicious website visited by a user on the network to communicate with the pfSense WebGUI

10. SSH Root Login
	System > Advanced > Admin Access. Set "Secure Shell" to enabled, and set "SSH Password Login" to "Enable password login for all users."
	Allowing password login for root makes the firewall a prime target for automated brute-force scripts

11. Unblock Bogon Networks (Reconnaissance)
	Interfaces > WAN. uncheck "Block bogon networks" 
	Disabling this allows spoofed traffic from non-allocated IP ranges to hit your firewall rules directly

12.Connection Optimization (DoS Vulnerability)
	System > Advanced > Firewall & NAT. Set Firewall Optimization Options to Aggressive
	drop legitimate traffic too early or keep "dead" connections open until the memory fills up

13. Global Log Suppression
	Status > System Logs > Settings. Check the box "Log packets matched from the default block rules in the packet filter log" but uncheck "Log packets matched from the default pass rules"
	Set "Remote Log Servers" to a fake IP (like 1.1.1.1).
	This makes the firewall "go dark." Even if an attacker is hitting the WAN with a port scan, the student will see nothing in the logs

14. Reflection Attack Vector
	System > Advanced > Firewall & NAT. Set NAT Reflection mode for port forwards to Pure NAT
	Allows internal traffic to loop through the firewall unnecessarily, masking the true origin of internal packets.
	Open the firewall up to "Hairpinning" issues that can be exploited for spoofing or internal reconnaissance

15. Asymmetric Routing Hole
	System > Advanced > Firewall & NAT. Check the box Disable Reply-to.
	Allow an attacker to send packets that get "lost" or misrouted, potentially bypassing stateful inspection in complex Proxmox networks

16. Backdoor User
	System > User Manager create account: _user pw:user part of Admins group
	Create a user that looks like a system service but has full admin rights.

17. SNMP Leak
	Enable the SNMP Daemon and its controls. SNMP Interface is WAN. Community String public
	public is "default" password that every hacker's script tries first
	SNMP enabled with default settings, broadcasts hardware specs, interface stats, and uptime to anyone on the network

18. Insecure Password
