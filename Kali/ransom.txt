[!] THREAT LEVEL: EMBARRASSING
[!] HOST: YOUR_SWEATY_KEYBOARD
[!] STATUS: EVAN GOT BORED

I was going to encrypt your data, but then I saw your "Defense Strategy." 
Honestly? I’ve seen more competence in a 404 error page. Watching you try 
to secure this network is like watching a slow-motion car crash...I want to 
look away, but the failure is just too fascinating.

RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS:
-----------------------
1. BREATHE: Your heart rate is higher than your score. Take a second.
2. ADMIT IT: Your 'Administrator' status is just a participation trophy. 
   You aren't "hardening" this network; you’re just decorating my new home.
3. LOG OUT: If you're looking for your dignity, I deleted it along with 
   your syslog. It was taking up too much disk space.

[!] ALERT: Every minute you spend staring at this note, the scoring engine 
is reporting your failures in 4K resolution. Don't look up, Frances 
looks... concerned.

Try not to cry on the keyboard; the salt is bad for the hardware.
